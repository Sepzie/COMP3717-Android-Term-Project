SkySurfer is a game inspired by Flappy Bird, made entirely using Kotlin. With its own unique theme, 
SkySurfer takes you on a thrilling adventure through the skies as you surf your way through the obstacles. 
The game features a sleek and engaging user interface that makes it easy to pick up and play, yet challenging 
enough to keep you hooked for hours. With its Login/Sign up feature, you can create your own profile and track your progress on the game's leaderboard, 
competing against other players to see who can surf the farthest distance.
